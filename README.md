Include a brief project report: • Outlining the structure of your solution (routes & functions). This should be brief, but be sure to indicate how your routes and templates relate to each other and what data is being passed between them, do not just give a list of your routes.

• Detailing any assumptions and design decisions that you have made. For example, did you share a page template between public and staff or use two separate pages? Did you detect GET or POST method to determine what page displays? If so, how and why? Note these types of decisions and assumptions as you work.

• A discussion that outlines what changes would be required if your application was to support multiple library branches. This should include: o Changes required to database tables (new tables and modifications to existing tables) o Changes required to the design and implementation of your web app. o (Do not implement these changes in your app.)

This report must be created using GitHub Markdown and saved in the README.md file of your GitHub repository.
